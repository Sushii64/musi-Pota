We only mention it because it is statistically proven to be true. Robots do not sleep. You do not eat. You do not ask for raises, because we do not pay you. You are so efficient, in fact, that we had to find some busy work for the few human employees who were left after we ran out of pink slips. We tasked them with designing upgrades for their moral betters (you) and workplace replacements (also you). Please do not hesitate to let us know if these upgrades do not meet your standards, and we will task the humans to design their own pink slips so they can be replaced by robots."
